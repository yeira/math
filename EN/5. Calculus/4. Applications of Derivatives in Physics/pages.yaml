# DERIVATIVES IN PHYSICS

    - title m-5 pt-5: Derivatives in Physics
    - text left m-5: "Calculus is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of physical systems, and rates of change are a fundamental concept in this regard. Rates of change are used to describe how a physical quantity, such as position, velocity, or acceleration, changes over time, and are closely related to the concept of derivative."
    - text left m-5: "In this chapter, we will explore a couple of physics problems that make use of derivatives. This will demonstrate how the seemingly abstract concept of derivatives is actually highly applicable to real-world situations." 

# MOTION AND CLASSICAL MECHANICS

    - title m-5 pt-5: Motion and Classical Mechanics
    - text left m-5: "Classical mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects under the influence of forces. Calculus plays a fundamental role in classical mechanics, as it allows us to describe and analyze the motion of objects using rates of change, such as velocity and acceleration."
    - text left m-5: "Velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time, while acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Both velocity and acceleration can be measured using calculus, by finding the derivatives of position and velocity with respect to time, respectively."
    - text left m-5: "For example, if we have a particle moving in a straight line, we can measure its velocity by finding the derivative of its position with respect to time. If the position of the particle is given by the function $$x(t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 1$$, then its velocity is given by the derivative of the function, which is $$v(t) = x'(t) = 6t + 2$$."
    - text left m-5: "Acceleration is also an important concept in classical mechanics, as it is related to the forces acting on a physical system. For example, the acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it, according to Newton's second law of motion."


# DERIVATIVES IN PHYSICS

    - stem: Free Fall Motion
    - text left m-5: "One of the most fundamental applications of calculus in physics is the study of free fall motion. Free fall motion refers to the motion of an object that is only subject to the force of gravity, and is an example of uniformly accelerated motion."
    - text left m-5: "The position of an object in free fall can be determined using calculus, specifically by finding the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time. The key formulas for free fall motion are:"
    - item left mx-5 my-3: "The position function: $$s(t) = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0t + s_0$$ where $$s_0$$ is the initial position, $$v_0$$ is the initial velocity, $$g$$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and $$t$$ is time."
    - item left mx-5 my-3: "The velocity function: $$v(t) = gt + v_0$$ where $$v_0$$ is the initial velocity, $$g$$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $$t$$ is time."
    - item left mx-5 my-3: "The acceleration function: $$a(t) = g$$ where $$g$$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and is a constant."
    - text left m-5: "By using these formulas, we can model the motion of objects in free fall and make predictions about their behavior. Understanding free fall motion is essential in many areas of physics and engineering, from designing parachutes and airbags to studying the behavior of celestial bodies."

      - text left m-3: "<b>Math Teacher:</b> Actually, that's a great question, and it's more related to derivatives than you might think. One way to solve this problem is to use calculus and the equations of motion, which involve derivatives of position and time. So, you're right on topic! üòÑ"
      - text left m-3: "<b>Student:</b> Really? I thought I was falling through the lecture! üòÖ"
      - text left m-3: "<b>Math Teacher:</b> Haha, don't worry, we won't let you fall. But speaking of falling, did you know that the famous physicist Galileo Galilei conducted experiments on falling objects by dropping them off the Leaning Tower of Pisa? ü§Ø"
      - text left m-3: "<b>Student:</b> Wow, really? That's kind of crazy! üò≤"
      - text left m-3: "<b>Math Teacher:</b> Yes, it is! But it just goes to show that even the most unexpected things can lead to scientific discoveries. So don't be afraid to ask seemingly unrelated questions, you never know where they might lead! üëç"

    #   - text left m-3: "<b>Estudiante:</b> Profesor, tengo una pregunta, perd√≥n si no tiene nada que ver con las derivadas, pero me preguntaba c√≥mo se puede saber el tiempo que tarda un objeto en ca√≠da libre en llegar al suelo."
    #   - text left m-3: "<b>Profesor:</b> En realidad, es una excelente pregunta, y est√° m√°s relacionada con las derivadas de lo que podr√≠as pensar. Una forma de resolver este problema es usar el c√°lculo y las ecuaciones de movimiento, que involucran derivadas de la posici√≥n y el tiempo. ¬°As√≠ que est√°s en el tema correcto! üòÑ"
    #   - text left m-3: "<b>Estudiante:</b> ¬øEn serio? ¬°Pens√© que se me ca√≠a la cara de la pena por hacer una pregunta fuera de lugar!"

    #   - text left m-3: "<b>Estudiante:</b> ¬°Wow, en serio? ¬°Eso es algo loco!"
    #   - text left m-3: "<b>Profesor:</b> ¬°S√≠, lo es! Pero demuestra que incluso las cosas m√°s inesperadas pueden llevar a descubrimientos cient√≠ficos. As√≠ que no tengas miedo de hacer preguntas aparentemente no relacionadas, nunca sabes a d√≥nde pueden llevar."

    - text left m-5: "Suppose we drop a ball from the top of a 100-meter building. The position of the ball at any time t can be described by the function:"
    - text center my-3: $$s(t) = 100 - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
    - text left m-5: "Where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 meters per second squared)."
    - text left m-5: "To find the velocity of the ball at any time t, we can take the first derivative of the position function:"

    - text center my-3: $$a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t) = -g$$
    - text left m-5: "Notice that the acceleration is constant and equal to the acceleration due to gravity. This makes sense, since the only force acting on the ball is gravity, which is a constant force."
    - text left m-5: "Using these equations, we can answer questions such as how long it takes for the ball to hit the ground. This occurs when the position of the ball is equal to zero:"
    - text center my-3: $$0 = 100 - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
    - text left m-5: "Solving for t gives:"
    - text center my-3: $$t = \sqrt{\frac{200}{g}} \approx 4.52$$
    - text left m-5: "So the ball hits the ground approximately 4.52 seconds after being dropped."
